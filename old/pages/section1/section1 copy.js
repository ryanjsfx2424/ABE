            For as long as humans have been fighting and fucking, Demonio has
            been on the Earth. He feeds on that raw energy. The line between
            hate and love is thin, indeed, and humans can’t help but dance from
            one side to the other. He has popped up in cultures across time and
            distance, appearing as a temptress or a warlord, a concubine or a
            mercenary. He himself cannot seem to find a foothold on one side or
            the other. Unlike humans, however, he has no problem with admitting
            such versatility. In fact, he revels in it. For a demon like him,
            the passion of the wedding bed is just as rejuvenating and exciting
            as the tension and grime of combat and war.{' '}

          <p className='mt-4 text-gray-500'>
            Demonio thrives on chaos. When the natural passions and hatreds of
            those around him dry up, he likes to sneak his way into people’s
            hearts and thoughts, picking apart the sanity of the people around
            him. The unravelling of his victim’s minds brings him more pleasure
            than a hundred sexual encounters, and it offers a deeper challenge
            than a thousand bloody battlefields.

          <p className='mt-4 text-gray-500'>
            That isn’t to say he doesn’t still enjoy those spaces, too, of
            course Over the years he’s made countless friends and enemies-
            Socrates to Lincoln to Stalin- unbothered by stigma or prejudice.
            Whenever conflict is brewing in the heads and hearts of mortals, he
            seems to find his way into the center of it all, travelling from
            time to time and place to place to find the worst of the worst and
            the best of the best.

          <p className='mt-4 text-gray-500'>
            He is distinctive no matter where he walks, but those he’s touched
            still struggle to remember anything about him until he’s in front of
            them again. A handy attribute with the majority of his circles
            falling on the wrong side of the law- both mortal and celestial.
            Like his demonic brothers and sisters, Demonio was cast from Heaven
            for debauchery and corruption. His soul, once pure, now seeks the
            energy of the damned and dangerous. Plenty of humans have rallied
            behind the cause of the angels and sought to rid the Earth of evil
            immortals like him, but none have stood strong in the face of a true
            denizen of Hell.

          <p className='mt-4 text-gray-500'>
            He has cemented himself firmly in the counterculture movement of the
            1970’s in America. It’s his favorite time and place to feed- the
            hippies are filled with rage at an unjust war and lust for their
            fellow protestors. Add in the rampant, heavy drugs, and everyone is
            on a hair trigger- whether the outcome is taking their partner in
            the middle of the park or throwing a brick through a cop car is a
            mystery even to the humans until they’re in the moment. It’s a den
            of vice and venom, and Demonio fits right in. At least, he used to.

          <p className='mt-4 text-gray-500'>
            Someone new has appeared in the crowds. Someone with an energy
            opposing Demonio’s. This newcomer dulls the world around her,
            sapping the passion of the humans and keeping it for herself. With
            enough rage for all the humans around him, Demonio is determined to
            wipe her off the face of space no matter what it takes.
